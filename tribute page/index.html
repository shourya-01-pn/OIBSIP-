          MAHATMA GANDHI
          Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi, is regarded as the Father of Nation. Gandhi was
          a social reformist and leader of Indian Independence Movement who introduced the idea of non-violent
          resistance called Satyagrah. Gandhi was born in Gujarat and studied law at the Inner Temple, London. After
          organising a civil disobedience movement for Indians living in South Africa, he returned to India in 1915. In
          India, he set out on a train journey to different parts of the country trying to understand problems of
          farmers, peasants and urban labourers and organising protests for them. He assumbed the leadership of Indian
          National Congress in 1921 and rose to become its most prominent leader and an iconic figure in Indian
          politics. He organised the Dandi Salt March in 1930 and Quit India Movement in 1942. He also worked for the
          upliftment of untouchables and have them a new name 'Harijan' meaning the children of God. Gandhi also wrote
          extensively for various newspapers and his symbol of self-reliance - the spinning wheel - became a popular
          symbol of Indian Independence Movement. Gandhi played a key role in pacifying people and averting the
          Hindu-Muslim riots as tensions rose before and during the partition of the country. He was shot dead by
          Nathuram Godse on January 31, 1948.
